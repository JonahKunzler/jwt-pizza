AGILE MOVEMENT ORIGINS

The Agile movement emerged as a result of issues with the  Waterfall model, especially in adaptability and performance. This led to software with late delivery, with a lot of expenses, and that didnâ€™t satisfy the needs of the consumers. Professionals in the 90s developed  procedures like Scrum, Extreme Programming, and the DSDM. Lean manufacturing and rapid prototyping is what inspired these professionals. It placed emphasis on recurring deliveries, feedback, and collaboration within teams.
In 2001,17 experts in software engineering met at a ski resort in Snowbird, Utah. They were upset with the heavyweight processes and wanted a better approach. They created the Agile Manifesto, which consists of a brief explanation of four values:
People and communication rather than methods and instruments.
Software that works is prioritized over exhaustive documentation.
Collaboration with customers takes precedence over negotiating contracts.
Responding to change instead of sticking to a plan.
12 principles were included to stress regular delivery, adjusting to changes, encouraging teams, and simplicity. The Agile movement was then sparked by this.
Agile brought a revolution to software development which improved its pace, teamwork, and focus on users. In relation to quality assurance, it included testing at every step of the process, using tools like Jest or Playwright. In the area of DevOps, it drove continuous integration and delivery to make deployment easier.
Agile's beginnings illustrate how curiosity through challenging obsolete methods and collaborating can change the whole software industry.
